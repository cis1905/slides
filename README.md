# CIS 1905 Slides (Spring 2024)

Hello!

This repository contains the lecture slides created for University of Pennsylvania's Course CIS 1905 Rust Programming. These slides are developed by myself and my TAs for the 2024 spring semester.

In case you want to follow along but do not have the opportunity to take the class or you are a future Rust lecturer who wants a jumpstart on creating lecture materials, you can reference these slides.

If there are any errors or issues, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

Good luck! :D
